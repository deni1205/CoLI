# CoLI JSX

## Why does CoLI supports JSX natively?

It seems wierd that jsx related declarations and functionalities on root level on coli module. this is because js/jsx and ts/tsx is little special to handle. Also via supporting jsx in the box can save lots of second handed implementations for building web apps.
